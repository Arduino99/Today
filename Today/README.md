# Today - A Daily Productivity App

## Overview

"Today" is a sleek productivity app developed as part of my hands-on journey through [Apple's Official Developer Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-today). This iOS app is designed to assist users in organizing their day-to-day tasks with an added touch of calm aesthetics and smooth animations.

## Key Learning Areas

During the development of "Today," I immersed myself in various iOS development topics and techniques:

1. **Adopting Collection Views**: Learned the efficient management and customization of data collections with `UICollectionView`, enhancing the app's scalability and maintainability.

2. **Displaying Collections**: Explored the flexible organization of collection view cells into different sections, optimizing data presentation and user navigation.

3. **Integration with EventKit**: Delved into the `EventKit` framework to enable interaction with users' calendar events and reminders, allowing for data sharing between the Reminders app and "Today."

4. **Custom Views & Animations**: Crafted custom views, including a progress tracking view, using UIKit. Grasped the essentials of creating dynamic visuals and ensuring their accessibility.

5. **Accessibility in UIKit**: Gained insights into making UI elements accessible, understanding the roles of labels, values, actions, and traits in enhancing app accessibility.
